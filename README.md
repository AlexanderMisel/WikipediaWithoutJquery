We are able to use Wikipedia without jQuery

## How to use Wikipedia jQuery-free
I assume you have an addon for blocking ads, i.e. Adblock, uBlock etc. Add a rule like this:
```
*&modules=jquery*
```
This will prevent jQuery from loading on Wikipedia.

But we will face with some small problems. Like using gadgets and wikitext editor. But with jQuery disabled, we will find a lot of fxxking modules are not loaded, that what we are happy to see.

According to [this MediaWiki page](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/JQuery), Wikipedia now uses ResourceLoader everywhere, so how could we work without it?
